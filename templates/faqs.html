                        Typical q-values are calculated by a p-value correction, such as Benjamini-Hochberg, and so p-values and q-values are always int he same order.
                        Instead, Nitecap orders all hypotheses by a statistic, "total delta," and q-values are in the same order as this statistic.
                        The Nitecap p-value of a hypothesis is not used in this ordering and so it is typical, though unconventional, to see p-values out of order.
                        The q-values should be treated as the more meaningful value when analyzing datasets with Nitecap.

                        ANOVA p-values are computed as a one-way ANOVA where the values are grouped by timepoint.
                        If your dataset does not contain any multiple replicates for any timepoint, or multiple cycles worth of data, then ANOVA has zero degrees of freedom and cannot be run.

                        Nitecap accepts most spreadsheets as is and supports Excel xls, xlsx spreadsheets (with your data in the first sheet in the file, if multiple sheets) as well as tab-separated and comma-separated files.
                        The data should be formatted with one column per sample and one row per one feature (e.g. gene, protein or other value measured).
                        Which column corresponds to which timepoint is set by the user after uploading the spreadsheet and no specific column headers are required.
                        For convenience, if sample columns are labelled as ZT## or CT## then the number values will be used to infer timepoints when possible.
                        Additional columns are no problem and can be used to label the values by selecting ID and multiple columns may be used as ID columns.
