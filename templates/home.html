    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Nitecap is a method for identification of circadian or rhythmic patterns in massively-parallel measurements of biological entities; for example, finding circadian behavior in timecourse gene expression data from RNA-Seq or microarrays.
        Our web interface makes it easy to run circadian analyses with just a spreadsheet of data, as well as to visualize the results.

        Nitecap requires at least one cycle's worth of data, but multiple cycles (for example, multiple days) worth of data produces stronger analyses.
        Nitecap searches for very general criteria for the shape of the expected data.
        Instead of comparing to cosine curves, like most methods, it prioritizes data that has a single peak and trough over the course of the cycle instead of more random ups-and-downs.
        Nitecap produces multiple-hypothesis-corrected results through q-values giving the false discovery rate (FDR) of the set of genes chosen.
        Our web interface helps investigators choose a reasonable q-value cutoff by visual inspection of the data.
