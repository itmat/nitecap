<p>Nitecap is a method for identification of circadian or rhythmic patterns in massively-parallel measurements of biological entities; for example, finding circadian behavior in timecourse gene expression data from RNA-Seq or microarrays. Our web interface makes it easy to run circadian analyses with just a spreadsheet of data, as well as to visualize the results.  </p>

<p>Nitecap is developed at the <a href="http://www.itmat.upenn.edu/">Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Pennsylvania</a>.
