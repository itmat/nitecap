<p>Nitecap is a method for identification of circadian or rhythmic patterns in massively-parallel measurements of biological entities; for example, finding circadian behavior in timecourse gene expression data from RNA-Seq or microarrays. Our web interface makes it easy to run circadian analyses with just a spreadsheet of data, as well as to visualize the results.  </p>
<p>
        Nitecap is an exploratory circadian data analysis tool aimed at high-throughput omics data.
        It provides a web-interface to examine your dataset with highly-responsive visualizations, allowing the easy viewing of hundreds or thousands of genes or other features.
        Nitecap computes some standard rhythmicity tests for you, including JTK, ARSER, Lomb-Scargle, Cosinor, and several tests to compare differential rhythmicity across two conditions (such as phase differences).
