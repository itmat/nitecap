<p>
        Nitecap is an exploratory circadian data analysis tool aimed at high-throughput omics data.
        It provides a web-interface to examine your dataset with highly-responsive visualizations, allowing the easy viewing of hundreds or thousands of genes or other features.
        Nitecap computes some standard rhythmicity tests for you, including JTK, ARSER, Lomb-Scargle, Cosinor, RAIN, and several tests to compare differential rhythmicity across two conditions (such as phase differences).
        See our <a href="user_guide">User Guide</a> for more help getting started.
